# About Project
### [DBD Statistics](www.dbd-statistics.ct8.pl) is an application created by players and programming enthusiasts for Dead by Daylight players, which thanks to Steam Web API allows you to check exact statistics, invisible in the game.

<br>

### We plan to develop the project, including adding more statistics, automating the setting of dates for individual events and most importantly: translating the application into [our own MVC framework](https://github.com/fkrzski/PHP-Kadarka-Framework), which has recently started to be created.
